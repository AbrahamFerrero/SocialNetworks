Abraham Ferrero's notes: Here is the last part of the whole block of courses. This is just the first week, the Uni proposed a warm up
project so you could start training for your own customized project later weeks on. 

Every file where I had to code are in the src/graph package. I had to implement two classes from the scratch, which are GraphEdge.java 
and GraphNode.java

Also, I had to code the "TO DO" tasks in CapGraph.java

There are some graders to test that everything was programmed properly.
